This is a basic tutorial for new users to play around with git


# Basic git commands:

clone -> bring a repo down from the internet (remote repository like Github) to your local machine

add -> track your files and changes with Git

commit -> save your changes into Git

push -> push your changes to your remote repo on Github (or another website)

pull -> pull changes down from the remote repo to your local machine

status -> check to see which files are being tracked or need to be commited

init -> use this command inside of your project to turn it into a Git repository and start using Git with that codebase
